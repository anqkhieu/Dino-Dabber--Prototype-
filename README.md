# Dino Dabber (Prototype) 🦖

Play chrome dino but with a twist... DABBING! 

*Scripted in Python with pose detection enabled by OpenCV.*

____

## Steps 👩‍🏫 

1. Navigate to `chrome://dino/` in your web browser. If you use a different browser, it may be `brave://dino/` or something you can google for a free online copy of the game. 
2. Donwload this GitHub repo. Navigate to the project folder through terminal, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download all required libraries. Now, run `dabDetection.py`.
3. Dab to start the game. A successful dab will mimic a keyboard space input to make the dino jump.
4. If your dabs aren't really dabs, you can edit `dabDetection.py` in the commented section `# The Mathematical Definition of a Dab` which dictates what angles your elbows and shoulders must be at to qualify as a dab. Change the numbers as you see fit!
5. Have fun! :)

I'm [@Ocarune](https://twitter.com/Ocarune) on Twitter, and I'm a side project enthusiast! You can find all my cool, creative shenanigans on my [website](https://anqkhieu.com/). Dino Dabber is currently in a proof-of-concept state as something I made for fun, and I may continue development in the future. My goal for 2022 is to make almost all of my work opensource, and so you can remix this project as you like! :)
